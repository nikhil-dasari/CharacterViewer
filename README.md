## CharacterViewer

- Using pods like Alamofire, AlamofireImage and SwiftyJson which makes our job much easier while downloading images, applying filters to images and parsing JSON objects
- For different apps to use the same shared code, I used a file named “App Info”. This file looks for the app name and decides the URL to use for downloading the characters. 
- Based on Requirements provided, I chose the app in Master Detail fashion. 
- Using the Collection View to display the list of Character’s or Character Images, since it allows us to define our own custom layouts. This helps us to easily change the layouts between List View and Grid View.
